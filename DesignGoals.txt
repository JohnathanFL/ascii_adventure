1. common_rpg should be just that - only things which are common to all rpgs that will be made.

2. Addons should be as easy as possible to use AND develop.
    - Will be accomplished through dynamically loading libraries.
3. Although common_rpg provides some specific stats (qi, soul, etc), there should be an interface to
   use custom stats in any addon.
    - Accomplished through Attributes (preferred) or RpgType MetaData (discouraged).
4. Each module should be completely free to implement/structure different elements of the journey
   as they see fit, while still being able to interop seamlessly with other modules.
    - Will still provide common setups/implementations in common_rpg, since not all addons will need custom versions.
    - Accomplished by using &Fn() stored in metadata.
